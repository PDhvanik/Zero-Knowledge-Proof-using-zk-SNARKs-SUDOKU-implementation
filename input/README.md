# input/

Example circuit inputs.

- `input.json` â€“ Template/example for creating inputs to the circuit. The app typically constructs inputs automatically from the UI, but this file is useful when running `snarkjs` commands manually during development.

Notes:
- Ensure that `unsolved` and `clueFlags` align and that `solved` obeys all Sudoku rules if you use manual workflows.
